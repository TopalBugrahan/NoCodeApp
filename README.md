# What Needs To Be Done To Run the Project

The first thing you need to do to run the project is to download the backend side of our project by going to https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=disayn&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8. Then you need to run the file named KouMobilio.sln in the beckend project with Visual Studio and stand up the server over https. 
By doing these, you have taken care of the backend part. Now it is time to run the frontend part, open the project you are currently in with Visual Studio Code. Then create a new terminal, type the npm start command in the terminal and wait for the project to open. :D
