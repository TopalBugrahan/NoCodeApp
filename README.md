# What Needs To Be Done To Run the Project

The first thing you need to do to run the project is to download the backend side of our project by going to https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=disayn&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8. Then you need to run the file named KouMobilio.sln in the beckend project with Visual Studio and stand up the server over https. 
By doing these, you have taken care of the backend part. Now it is time to run the frontend part, open the project you are currently in with Visual Studio Code. Then create a new terminal, type the npm start command in the terminal and wait for the project to open. :D

There will be a design page for any project you will log in, there are elements you will use on the left side, you can drag and drop these elements to the design screen and make your design. In addition, the bar on the right side opens the properties of the element you click on, these properties change according to the element, here you can change its position or size in the mobile screen, background color, etc.

With the global style button at the top left of the design screen, you can set a style for the element you want and then integrate it wherever you put a button.

At the bottom of the right bar of the clicked element there are buttons to delete the element and add an action. Add action button takes you to add action page where you can add many actions to the element.
